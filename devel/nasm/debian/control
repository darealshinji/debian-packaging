Description: General-purpose x86 assembler
 Netwide Assembler.  NASM will currently output flat-form binary files,
 a.out, COFF and ELF Unix object files, and Microsoft 16-bit DOS and
 Win32 object files.
 .
 Also included is NDISASM, a prototype x86 binary-file disassembler
 which uses the same instruction table as NASM.
