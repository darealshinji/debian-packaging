GNU Compiler Collection
=======================

This build of the GNU Compiler Collection includes front ends for C, C++,
Objective-C, Objective-C++ and Java, as well as libraries for these languages
(libstdc++, libgcj,...). GCC was originally written as the compiler for the
GNU operating system. The GNU system was developed to be 100% free software,
free in the sense that it respects the user's freedom.
