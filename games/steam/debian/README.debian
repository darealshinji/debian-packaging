Audio Configuration
-------------------

The easiest way to get sound working in steam is to setup and configure
pulseaudio (see https://wiki.debian.org/PulseAudio for hints).

If you're not using pulseaudio, there are a couple environment variables
that steam will use.  An example steam launch with settings for alsa is:

  $ SDL_AUDIO_DRIVER=alsa AUDIODEV=hw:0,0 steam

For more information, see the documentation for alsa, sdl, etc.
