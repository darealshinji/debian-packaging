YASM
====

Yasm is a complete rewrite of the NASM assembler. It supports multiple assembler
syntaxes (eg, NASM, GAS, TASM, etc.) in addition to multiple output object formats
(binary objects, COFF, Win32, ELF32, ELF64) and even multiple instruction sets
(including AMD64). It also has an optimiser module.
